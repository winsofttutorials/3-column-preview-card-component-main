## Overview

This is a design of a 3-culumn-preview-card using HTML and CSS.
In this design I also added a transition to the card info using @keyframes to that.
I approached it using grid layering.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Desktop first then Mobile approach
- On hover of the button you have the state displayed for it.

## My process

I used grid to set up my layers.
@min-width: 600px i had the break to a mobile screen.

### What I learned

It helped me improve on my Responsive designing.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
